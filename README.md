# Advanced-Flight-Simulator

Description
The Advanced Flight Simulator is a 3D flight simulation experience built with Three.js that runs directly in the browser. This project features:

Realistic flight physics with lift, drag, and gravity calculations

Interactive 3D aircraft model with animated control surfaces (ailerons, elevators, rudder, flaps, landing gear)

Procedurally generated world with cities, airports, and countryside

Dynamic minimap with waypoint navigation system

Multiple camera views (cockpit and chase views)

Responsive controls for both desktop and mobile devices

Real-time flight data dashboard

Day/night cycle with atmospheric effects
